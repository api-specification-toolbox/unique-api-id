# Unique API Identifiers
This is a project to develop a unique identifier for each public API.

# Draft Proposal
Here is the format being proposed as a starting point for each identifier.

- **domain** - The root domain for organization behind API.
- **org** - The organization or team the API is from.
- **protocol** - The protocol used as a transport.
- **resource** - A general or specific resource.
- **version** - The version of the API being identified.

These would represent each part of the id, delimited using a colon.

## Example ids
Here are some example unique identifiers for some of the leading APIs.

- twilio:public:http1:sms:2010-04-01
- stripe:public:http1:payments:v1
- spotify:public:http1:payments:v1
- youtube:public:http1:videos:v3
- youtube:public:http1:videos:v3

## Relevant Example
This is an example of a naming system for IT systems and software.

- (**Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary**](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe)
- (**Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Documentation**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir7695.pdf)

This provides a model that we can use to drive the formalization of this.
